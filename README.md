# Link_state_Routing
For  this  assignment, 
your  task  is  to 
implement  the  link  state  routing  protocol.  Your  prog
ram  will  be 
running at all routers
in the
specified network. At each router
,
the input to your program is 
a set of directly 
attached routers
(i.e. neighbours) and the
costs of these links. Each router
wil
l broadcast link
-
state packets 
to all other routers
in the network. Y
our routing program at each router
should report the least
-
cost path 
and the associated cost 
to all other routers
in the network. Your program should b
e able to deal with failed 
routers
.
